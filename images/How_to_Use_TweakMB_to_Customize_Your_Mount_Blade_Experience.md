In this article, we will show you how to use TweakMB to customize your Mount & Blade experience. We will also provide some examples of tweaks that you can apply to enhance your gameplay.
 
## What is TweakMB?
 
TweakMB is a program that provides an easy-to-use interface for activating and modifying gameplay tweaks in Mount & Blade. It works by editing the module text files that contain the game's data. You can make as many modifications as you want within the program, then save all of them at the same time. Using TweakMB is very similar to modifying the module text files manually, but TweakMB automates the entire process (meaning it's much easier and faster to use), and also reduces the chances of user error.
 
TweakMB supports both Mount & Blade and Mount & Blade: Warband, as well as many popular mods for both games. You can find a list of supported mods on the TweakMB page at Nexus Mods[^1^]. If a mod is not listed there, you can still load it using TweakMB, but some tweaks may be unavailable depending on the mod.
 
## How to Install and Use TweakMB?
 
To install TweakMB, you need to have the .Net Framework 3.5 installed on your computer. If you don't have it, you can download it from Microsoft's website (). Then, download the latest version of TweakMB from Nexus Mods[^1^] or from its official website (). Extract the downloaded .zip file to any location on your computer, then run "TweakMB.exe".
 
To use TweakMB, follow these steps:
 
1. Run TweakMB and click the red text "Load Module (Warband)" in the top-right corner.
2. Select the mod that you want to tweak from the list. If your mod is not listed, select "Native" or "Floris Mod Pack 2.50" as a base.
3. In the "Browse for Folder" window that pops up, browse to your mod folder. By default, this is in C:\Program Files (x86)\Mount&Blade - Warband\Modules.
4. Once your mod is loaded, you will see a list of categories on the left side of the program. Click on any category to see the available tweaks for that category.
5. To activate or modify a tweak, check or uncheck the box next to it, or enter a value in the text field. You can hover over any tweak to see a description of what it does.
6. When you are done tweaking, click on "Apply Changes" at the bottom-right corner of the program. This will save your changes to the module text files.
7. Launch Mount & Blade and enjoy your customized game!
